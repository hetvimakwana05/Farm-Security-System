# ðŸŒ¾ Farm Security System using PIR Sensor (No Microcontroller)

This project presents a simple, affordable, and effective security solution for farms using a **Passive Infrared (PIR) sensor**. The system detects motion and activates an alarm to alert the farmer, helping protect valuable assets from intruders or animal threats â€” **without using any microcontroller or programming**.

## ðŸ”§ Features

- No microcontroller or Arduino required
- Detects motion using PIR sensor (infrared heat)
- Activates alarm system via relay
- Low-cost and easy to implement
- Works in various weather conditions

## ðŸ›  Components Used

- PIR Sensor
- Relay Module
- Buzzer / Siren
- Transistor (BC547)
- Diode, Resistors, Capacitor
- Power Supply (12V battery)
- LED Indicator

## ðŸ§ª How It Works

- PIR detects motion by sensing changes in infrared radiation.
- On detection, the sensor output goes HIGH.
- This triggers the transistor, activating the relay.
- Relay turns on the buzzer/alarm and LED for visual indication.
